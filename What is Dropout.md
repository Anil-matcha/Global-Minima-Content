# What is Dropout

Dropout is a regularization technique



Before we understand what is regularization, we need to understand what is underfitting, Good fit and Overfitting

Underfit is when the capacity of model is low

Overfit is when the model has a high capacity and has just memorized the data

If train accuracy < 100% then it's an underfit

If there is a huge difference between train and test accuracy it is considered an overfit

## How dropout helps in regularization

1. Makes the network avoid over-reliance
2. Reduces the capacity of network
3. Ensemble of networks
