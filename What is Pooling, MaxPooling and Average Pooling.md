# Pooling, Max Pooling and Average Pooling

A CNN consists of 3 structural components

1. Convolution layers
2. Pooling layers
3. Fully connected layers



### Pooling

Pooling is the operation of down-sampling input

**Average Pooling** :-

Max pooling preferred over average pooling

**Why we need pooling**

1. To reduce the input size
2. To achieve local translation and rotation invariance
