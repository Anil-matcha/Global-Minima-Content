# What next to do after image classification ?

# Image Classification

# Object Detection

Multiple architectures like all variants RCNN, YOLO, SSD, Retinanet etc.

RCNN variants come under two stage detection

YOLO, SSD come under single stage detection

Datasets :- COCO, Pascal VOC

# Image segmentation

Classify each and every pixel as belonging to a class or not

FCN, Unet, Deep Lab V3, Mask RCNN

Datasets :- Cityscape, Camvid, KITTI

# Object Tracking

Architectures :- Siamese networks, GOTURN

Dataset :- MOT, Tracknet

# Action Recognition

Architectures :- CNN+LSTM, Two stream neural networks, 3D CNN

Datasets :- UCF101, Kinetics-600

AI trainer by Cult-Fit

# Generative Adversial Network

Build a basic GAN like celebrity face generation with DCGAN

Try a complex GAN like Pix2Pix or CycleGAN then

Architectures :- DCGAN, CycleGAN, Pix2Pix, CGAN, WGAN etc.

# 3D computer vision

Until now we have been looking at 2d data. But as humans we understand from 3d images. Computers do this using point clouds generated by using multiple cameras.

Architectures :- Pointnet, Shapenet
